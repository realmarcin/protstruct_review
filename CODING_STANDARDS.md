# Coding standards — protstruct_review

<!-- catalog-state: tasks=T01–T17; count=17; drivers=17 -->

Repo-specific rules a reviewer can cite as **hard violations**, not judgement calls. These are
the invariants of *this* harness — they sit on top of, and override, the generic code-smell
baseline any review already carries. Generic style (naming, dead code, error handling) is not
repeated here; only what is particular to this project is.

The authority for domain conventions is `/protstruct-eval` (`.claude/skills/protstruct-eval/SKILL.md`).
Where this file and the handbook overlap, they must agree; if they drift, that is itself a defect.

## Trust model (load-bearing — never violate)

1. **No PHENIX-grades-PHENIX.** Every gradeable task must be cross-checked by at least one
   independent, non-cctbx oracle (MolProbity, ChimeraX, REFMAC/Servalcat, gemmi, DSSP, DockQ, …).
   A task whose only oracle is another PHENIX/cctbx tool is a violation — add an external oracle
   or state explicitly in the row that none exists.
2. **The deposition is the tiebreaker**, not either tool: a deposited PDB/EMDB entry or a
   publication Table 1 breaks a cross-tool disagreement.
3. **Every quantitative claim is re-measured, never transcribed** from the agent under evaluation.
   If a number in a QDS narrative cannot be traced to a re-run oracle measurement, it does not
   belong there.

## Catalog and its views

4. **`ref/catalog.yaml` is canonical.** `ref/tasks_and_evaluations.tsv` and `.md` are *views*.
5. **The TSV is generated — never hand-edit it.** Regenerate:
   `python3 scripts/records_to_tsv.py ref/catalog.yaml --kind catalog -o ref/tasks_and_evaluations.tsv`.
   It must match a fresh regeneration byte-for-byte (`scripts/validate.sh` enforces this).
6. **The `.md` is hand-written prose**, but every catalog task must have a `### T<NN> ` section in
   it (also enforced by `validate.sh`). Update it in the *same commit* as the catalog change.
7. **Example datasets are concrete deposition IDs** (`1AKE`, `EMDB-11668`), never "any
   high-resolution structure" or "deposited entries with curated mappings". A run must be
   reproducible without a scavenger hunt.

## Metrics

8. **Every task needs at least one gradeable metric, and gradeable means numeric** — a number two
   tools can disagree about. No "good fit", no bare pass/fail prose as the sole metric.
9. **Label-valued metrics** (a secondary-structure state, a CATH id, a CAPRI class) are allowed
   only as *descriptive content*: they carry `pass_status: informational` and ride alongside a
   numeric metric, never instead of one. The idiom for grading categorical data is to score the
   *agreement between two independent labellers* as a number
   (e.g. `T15_secondary_structure_agreement` = three-state DSSP-vs-STRIDE concordance).
10. **Pass thresholds do not live in the catalog** — the catalog is metric-shape, not thresholds.
    They live in per-task `driving_example_T<NN>.md` files, present for all 17 catalog tasks
    (T01–T17). Every numeric threshold is defined once in
    `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` with a `[provenance]` tag naming its source; drivers cite it
    rather than restating values, and a new threshold without an admissible provenance is not
    admissible. **Negative-control clause:** the §6 verdict thresholds are re-derived from committed
    round records by `scripts/bench_recover_leg.py`, so there the registry *restates* the
    record-derived constants and validate 3b (`check_negative_control_records.py`) asserts the
    restatement is exact — the record is the source, the registry the human-readable copy.
    The guard's own table of governed values (`ref/thresholds_and_standards.yaml`: read-pattern,
    consumers, retired literals) is guard data, not a definition; a threshold's value still lives
    only in the `.md` row the pattern reads.

## QDS emitter (`scripts/qds_emit.py`)

11. **One routing table.** A single `METRIC_TO_QDS_SLOT` maps every metric id to its destination.
    Never add a second table. A metric that must land in more than one block uses a **list** of
    `(block, slot)` pairs as its value — not a parallel mapping.
12. **Route by canonical metric id, never by substring.** The table is validated against
    `ref/catalog.yaml` at import; a typo must be a hard error, not a silent miss.
13. **Fail-hard on implied content.** If an eval carries content that implies a QDS block, the
    emitter must emit that block or raise `QdsCompletenessError` (which subclasses `SystemExit` by
    design — preserve that). Adding a metric at a new `scope` means adding its implied-block rule.
13b. **Fail-hard on cctbx-only coverage (#315).** A gradeable applied task whose cross-tool
    coverage is cctbx-only or unclassifiable refuses to emit unless the eval declares a matching
    `CrossToolWaiver` (task ref, reason, date); the waiver annotates the coverage row it excuses.
    Non-cctbx-only coverage is deliberately NOT gated — the rule forbids self-grading, not
    independent-only evidence. Committed QDS files are checked by
    `scripts/check_qds_trust_invariant.py` (validate step 3c) with pre-2026-08-13 history
    grandfathered by name.
14. **Behaviour-preserving refactors must be proven so.** After touching the emitter, regenerate a
    committed QDS and diff it: only `issued_at` may differ.

## Schema

15. **`schemas/protstruct_review.yaml` is the source; `protstruct_review/models.py` is generated**
    (`gen-pydantic`). Regenerate and commit the models in the same commit as any schema change —
    never hand-edit the models.
16. The single-file schema is past its ~600-line split guideline **by design** while there is one
    consumer and no subset reader; see `schemas/README.md`. Do not split it speculatively — the
    trigger is a *second consumer*, not the line count.

## Serialisation and scripts

17. **Emit YAML with `yaml.safe_dump` on a data structure**, never by appending f-string lines. Use
    `sort_keys=False` (field order is meaningful — these files are read by humans) and
    `allow_unicode=True` (units like `Å`, `Å²` must not become escape sequences). Hand-rendered
    YAML bypasses the LinkML validator and invites quoting bugs.
18. **Shell gates must fail loudly.** Under `set -euo pipefail`, a crash inside a `< <(...)`
    process substitution is *not* caught. Capture a subprocess's output into a variable with an
    explicit status check *before* consuming it, so an enumeration failure aborts rather than
    yielding an empty list that passes silently.
19. **Scripts derive `REPO_ROOT` from their own location** (`__file__` / `BASH_SOURCE`), never a
    hardcoded absolute path. No `/Users/...` in any `.py`, `.sh`, schema, or doc.
19b. **Benchmark tool execution is shell-free.** Pass paths and arguments as a list through
    `scripts/toolchain.py`; use `cwd` and log file handles for redirection. Only the audited CCP4
    adapter may source a vendor setup script. PHENIX, CCP4, TM-align, DSSP, probe, and reduce paths
    and pinned versions are defined once in that module and overridden only with `PROTSTRUCT_*`
    environment variables.

## The gate

20. **`bash scripts/validate.sh` must be green before commit.** It runs LinkML validation of every
    record, referential integrity, the emitter regression tests, and the published-view drift
    check. A change that needs the gate relaxed needs the gate *fixed*, not bypassed.
