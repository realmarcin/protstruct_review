"""Unit tests for the two scripts that exist to catch other scripts' mistakes.

`check_registry_figures.py` and `check_referential_integrity.py` are guards. This
repo's own triage ranks "a guard that does not guard" second only to a wrong published
claim, because a guard with a hole hides the whole class beneath it -- and both of
these had one:

  #116  `nesting_check()` compared four counts it derived ITSELF from the TSV and never
        read the registry. Those inclusions hold by construction of `append_results`,
        so no run of the pipeline could fail them; meanwhile the registry's 59, 35 and
        63 were pinned to no literal at all.
  #118  the docstring promised a `structure_ref` check that was never implemented --
        `local_structure_ids` sat computed and unused -- so a dangling structure_ref
        passed silently through the gate that exists to catch dangling refs.

Every test below must FAIL if its fix is reverted; a test that passes either way is
the same defect one level up. No network, no PHENIX; safe to run anywhere.
