"""Pure-logic unit tests for the record-level harness tools.

Covers the parsing and conversion steps that turn a tool's output into a graded row.
Both defects pinned here are of the same shape: a value that looked right for the
wrong reason, and would have gone on looking right until the input changed.

  #121  the twin-operator flag keyed on `Twin fraction estimates by twinning operator`,
        a section header ctruncate prints UNCONDITIONALLY -- above either an operator
        table or the words "No operators found". It gave the right answer only because
        a different literal happened to match first.
  #126  the unit regex had no `Å²`, so a BSA or Wilson-B cell became `value_text`.
        `qds_emit._strongest()` ranks numeric above text, so a real measurement lost to
        a weaker text-only one from another tool.

No network, no CCP4; safe to run anywhere.
