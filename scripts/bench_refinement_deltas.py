"""Benchmark the §4 refinement Δ-tolerances by actually refining.

`ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` §4 governs the compare→refine flow and asserts how
far a refinement may move a quantity before it counts as degradation:

  - ΔRMSD sanity            RMSD_post ≤ RMSD_pre + 0.05 Å
  - Geometry did not degrade  clashscore_post ≤ max(clashscore_pre, 4);
                              favored_post ≥ min(favored_pre, 97 %);
                              rotamer outliers_post ≤ max(outliers_pre, 2 %)

These are **not** cross-tool agreement tolerances, so none of the rounds 1-4 machinery
applies: the question is not "do two tools agree" but "how much does a refinement that
did *not* degrade the model actually move these numbers". That needs a refine →
re-measure loop, which is what this does.

Method — the null case. Each deposited model is re-refined against its own deposited
data with `phenix.refine`. The model is already at its refinement optimum, so a
correctly-behaving refinement should move these quantities very little; whatever
spread remains is the floor a Δ band has to clear.

Every tolerance above mixes a **Δ band** with an **absolute floor** (4, 97 %, 2 %).
They are different claims and only the Δ is measurable this way, so the floors are
reported separately: how often deposited structures violate them tells you whether
they are refinement checks at all or simply quality bars in disguise.

RMSD is computed **without re-superposition**, over matched (chain, resseq) Cα pairs.
Refinement preserves the coordinate frame, so the raw shift is the quantity of
interest, and superposing first would absorb part of what is being measured.
