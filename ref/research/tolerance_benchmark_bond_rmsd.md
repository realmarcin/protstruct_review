# Tolerance benchmark — bond-length RMSD (phenix.model_statistics vs gemmi rmsz)

Settles the `Bond-length RMSD | ± 0.003 Å` `[template]` tolerance in
`ref/thresholds_and_standards.md`. The domain-expert review made bond **angle** RMSD
library-conditional — PHENIX's conformation-dependent library (CDL) vs the CCP4 monomer library
shifts angles by 0.3–0.4° for library reasons alone — but left bond **length** untested against the
same library difference. This is that test.

Reproduce with:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_t05_bond_rmsd.py --ids-file <ids.json> --cache <dir> --json <out.json>
```

## Configuration

| | phenix.model_statistics | gemmi rmsz |
|---|---|---|
| Restraint library | PHENIX default (CDL since ~2016) | CCP4 monomer library (`$CLIBD_MON`, Engh & Huber lineage — the library REFMAC uses) |
| Reported line | `covalent geometry : bond <rmsd> (<n>)` | `Model rmsD: bond: <rmsd>` |

**Recipe correction:** `ref/oracle_tools.md` cited `gemmi validate` for this comparison. There is no
such gemmi subcommand — the geometry validator is **`gemmi rmsz`**, and it prints rmsZ (unitless
Z-scores) *and* rmsD (Å) on separate lines. Only the **rmsD** line is comparable to PHENIX's RMSD;
comparing PHENIX's Å figure against gemmi's Z-score line would be a units error, not a disagreement.

PHENIX's `covalent geometry : bond` figure is used rather than its headline `Bond:` line, because
the headline includes SS-bond and link restraints while the covalent-geometry figure matches the
bond population gemmi counts.

Test set: 17 deposited X-ray models, bond RMSD 0.0018–0.0175 Å, 440–9634 restrained bonds.

Signed: gemmi reads higher in **17 of 17**.

## Findings

**1. ±0.003 Å fails, systematically.** Even on the six models where both tools restrain exactly the
same number of bonds, the median disagreement is **0.0040 Å** and the max **0.0070 Å** — the
tolerance is exceeded by the *typical* case, not the tail. The direction is fixed: gemmi higher in
17/17, with no sign changes.

**2. ~~The cause is the restraint library~~ — CORRECTED, see
`tolerance_benchmark_restraint_library.md`.** This section originally attributed the gap to the
restraint library, by analogy with the review's bond-angle finding. A follow-up benchmark isolated
the library inside a single implementation (PHENIX with CDL vs Engh & Huber) and found it accounts
for **21 %** of the gap on matched-bond-count models (median 0.00085 of 0.00405 Å; 9 % across all
17, deflated by the count-mismatched models). The rest is implementation:
how the two tools enumerate and sum bond restraints. The tolerance below is unaffected; its
*explanation* was wrong, which matters because "match the libraries" is useless advice when the
library is not the problem. For bond **angles** the library-conditional framing does hold (51 % of
the angle gap, median 0.265°).

**3. The two tools frequently do not restrain the same bonds — and the mismatch is often a factor of
two.** Only 6/17 agree on the bond count. Several disagree ~2× (30TW 4677 vs 9544; 28SX 2330 vs
4769; 9HX9 8454 vs 16758), consistent with different handling of alternate conformations. Where the
counts diverge, the disagreement blows out to 0.0667 Å — 22× the old tolerance. A bond-count
mismatch means the two RMSDs are sums over different restraint populations and are not comparable.

## Applied tolerance

> **|Δ| ≤ 0.008 Å, and only when both tools restrain the same number of bonds.** With **matched
> restraint libraries** the tolerance is **|Δ| ≤ 0.006 Å** — barely tighter, because the library is
> only ~21 % of the disagreement (`tolerance_benchmark_restraint_library.md`). Expect gemmi/CCP4-library figures to read
> **high** against PHENIX/CDL; a negative Δ is off-distribution. When the bond counts differ (11/17
> here), the comparison is **void**: report both figures with their counts rather than a Δ.

0.008 Å covers 6/6 of the matched-count subset (max 0.0070) with margin. This loosens the tolerance
by ~2.7×, which is the honest direction: the old ±0.003 Å was tighter than the library difference
allows, so it would have flagged correct models as disagreeing.

## Scope limits

- Cross-library only. The matched-library case was measured separately in
  `tolerance_benchmark_restraint_library.md` and is **0.006 Å** — not "much tighter", because the
  library turned out to be a minor term for bond lengths.
- The ~2× bond-count mismatches are attributed to alternate-conformation handling by inspection, not
  verified — the scripts record the counts but do not diff the restraint lists.
- 17 X-ray models, bond RMSD 0.0018–0.0175 Å. Models with unusual ligands or heavy covalent
  modification are not represented, and are where monomer-library coverage differences would be
  largest.
- One version pair: PHENIX 2.0-5936 and gemmi against CCP4 9.0.015's monomer library — gemmi **0.7.4** (CCP4's bundled binary) for the rmsz legs, see the disclosure below.

> **Disclosure (2026-08-29, #502).** The `gemmi rmsz` legs above ran under the sourced CCP4 environment, which prepends `ccp4-9/bin` to `PATH` — and that directory carries CCP4's bundled **gemmi 0.7.4**. So the rmsz figures in this document were produced by 0.7.4, not the Homebrew 0.7.5 named here and in the run manifests; the PHENIX and monomer-library identities are unaffected. A one-model spot check (1d3z, full rmsz output) is byte-identical between the two versions; the tables were not re-run and are not re-judged. From PR #501 on, every gemmi invocation resolves through `toolchain.gemmi_executable()` (`PROTSTRUCT_GEMMI` or PATH, absolute path in argv), and the run manifest written by `tool_versions()` records that resolved path and version alongside the measurement.
