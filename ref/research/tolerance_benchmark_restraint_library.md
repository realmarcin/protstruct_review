# Tolerance benchmark — restraint library vs implementation in geometry RMSD

Closes the matched-library gap PR #28 opened, and **corrects a claim PR #28 made**.

PR #28 measured bond-length RMSD across libraries (PHENIX/CDL vs gemmi/CCP4 monomer library), set
±0.008 Å, and attributed the gap to the restraint library — by analogy with the domain-expert
review's bond-*angle* finding. That attribution was never tested. It is wrong for bond lengths.

Reproduce with:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_t05_restraint_library.py --ids-file <ids.json> --cache <dir> --json <out.json>
```

## Configuration

Three configurations over the same 17 deposited models, which lets the disagreement be decomposed
instead of merely measured:

| | Tool | Library |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | `phenix.model_statistics restraints_library.cdl=True` | CDL (PHENIX default) |
| **B** | `phenix.model_statistics restraints_library.cdl=False` | Engh & Huber |
| **C** | `gemmi rmsz` | CCP4 monomer library (E&H-derived) |

- **A vs B** — pure **library** effect: one implementation, one code path, only the targets change.
- **B vs C** — near-matched library, different implementations: mostly **implementation**.
- **A vs C** — the cross-library figure PR #28 published.

"Near-matched" is load-bearing in B vs C: the CCP4 monomer library is E&H-derived but not identical
to PHENIX's non-CDL targets, and the two tools may restrain different populations. B vs C is
therefore an **upper bound** on the matched-library floor, not the floor itself.

## Results

Restricted to the 6 models where PHENIX and gemmi restrain the **same number of bonds**:
library median 0.00085 Å (max 0.00174), implementation median 0.00320 Å (max **0.00578**).

## Findings

**1. PR #28's attribution was wrong for bond lengths.** On the 6 models where PHENIX and gemmi
restrain the **same number of bonds** — the only population where the bond-RMSD tolerance considers
the comparison valid at all — the restraint library accounts for **21 %** of the gap (median
0.00085 of 0.00405 Å). Across all 17 models it is 9 %, but that figure is deflated by the
count-mismatched models, whose implementation term is contaminated (30TW alone contributes
+0.067 Å). Quote **21 %**; the conclusion is the same either way — the library is the minority
term — but 9 % overstates the point by more than double.

Switching PHENIX from CDL to Engh & Huber is the *whole* library difference, isolated inside one
implementation, and it barely moves the number. The remaining ~79 % is implementation: how gemmi and
PHENIX enumerate and sum bond restraints. The ±0.008 Å tolerance itself stands; only its stated
*cause* was wrong, and that matters because "match the libraries" is useless advice if the library is
not the problem.

**2. For bond angles the library-conditional framing is right.** The library accounts for **51 %** of
the cross-library angle gap (56 % on matched-count models — stable, unlike the bond-length share), with a median effect of **0.265°** and a max of 0.471° — an in-repo,
independent confirmation of the review's "0.3–0.4° for library reasons alone", which until now was
a literature claim the harness had never reproduced. Bond angles and bond lengths simply do not
behave the same way, and the review's angle finding does not transfer.

**3. The matched-library floor is barely tighter than the cross-library tolerance.** On matched bond
counts the implementation term is median 0.0032 Å, max **0.0058 Å**, against the cross-library
±0.008 Å. Matching libraries buys almost nothing for bond lengths, which follows directly from
finding 1.

## Applied

> **Bond-length RMSD keeps |Δ| ≤ 0.008 Å** across implementations, gated on equal bond count. The
> **matched-library** case is *not* meaningfully tighter — use **|Δ| ≤ 0.006 Å** — because the
> library contributes only ~21 % of the disagreement on valid (matched-count) comparisons. Do not expect matching libraries to bring two
> implementations into agreement on bond lengths.
>
> **Bond-angle RMSD** keeps its library-conditional treatment, now with an in-repo magnitude: the
> library alone shifts angle RMSD by a median **0.265°** (max 0.471°).

## Scope limits

- The library's share of the gap is subset-dependent for bond lengths (21 % on matched-count models,
  9 % across all 17) because the count-mismatched models inflate the implementation term. It is
  stable for angles (51 %/56 %). Both readings support the same conclusion.
- B vs C is an upper bound on the matched-library floor: E&H and the CCP4 monomer library are
  related but not identical, so some library residue remains inside the "implementation" term.
- The bond-count mismatch that dominates the tail (30TW, +0.067 Å) is unexplained beyond the
  inspection in `tolerance_benchmark_bond_rmsd.md` — the scripts record counts but do not diff the
  restraint lists.
- 17 X-ray models; ligand-heavy models, where monomer-library coverage differs most, are not
  represented.
- One version pair: PHENIX 2.0-5936, gemmi 0.7.5, CCP4 9.0.015 monomer library.
