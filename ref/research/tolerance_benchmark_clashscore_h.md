# Tolerance benchmark — clashscore and H-placement (cctbx vs Richardson standalone)

Settles two `[template]` tolerances in `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` that shared a tool pair and
rested on a **single** in-repo observation (1SAR: 3.13 cctbx vs 3.63 standalone):

- Clashscore ± 1.0
- H-placement: H-atom count within ± 2 %, same Asn/Gln/His flip set, clashscore delta within ± 1.0

Reproduce with:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_t05_clashscore_h.py --ids-file <ids.json> --cache <dir> --json <out.json>
```

## Configuration

Both paths are the same pipeline — build hydrogens, count serious overlaps — in different
implementations:

- **cctbx**: `phenix.clashscore model.pdb` (hydrogens built internally).
- **standalone**: Richardson `reduce -build`, then `probe -u -q -mc -het -once`, with the score
  summed here by the MolProbity definition: serious clashes (overlap ≥ 0.4 Å) per 1000 atoms,
  counting each atom pair once. Validated against `phenix.clashscore` on 1SAR (32.25 vs 32.59).

Standalone `reduce` is run **twice**, `-build` (electron-cloud-center H) and `-build -nuclear`
(nuclear H), because the H-build convention is the suspected dominant term and the only way to
measure it is to vary it. cctbx defaults to electron-cloud placement for X-ray models, so
`-build` is the matched configuration and `-nuclear` is the mismatched one.

Test set: 10 deposited X-ray models with no deposited hydrogens, clashscore 1.18–13.61. Models that
already carry H are skipped — they would test neither H-builder.

## Findings

**1. The H-build convention is not a caveat, it is the entire signal.** Matched, the two
implementations agree to a median of 0.115 clashscore units. Mismatched, they disagree by a median
of **9.95** and up to **22.97** — 10 to 23 times the ±1.0 tolerance. The earlier in-repo 1SAR
observation (Δ ≈ 0.5) understated this by more than an order of magnitude, because it happened to
compare two electron-cloud builds. Nuclear H sit further from their parent atoms, so every H-bearing
contact tightens and the clash count roughly triples.

**2. ±1.0 is right for the matched case but needs a relative term.** Nine of ten pairs agree within
0.4. The exception, 24MR (Δ 2.27), is the highest-clashscore model in the set at 13.61 — the
disagreement is 17 % of the value. A clashscore of 30 compared to a tolerance of ±1.0 is a 3 %
demand; that is tighter than these implementations support.

**3. The H-count tolerance is ~150× too loose, and it checks the wrong thing.** Observed H-count
differences are **0.013 % at worst** against an allowed 2 %. The count is essentially always
identical because both builders place the same *number* of hydrogens on the same residues — what
differs is *where* they put them. A ±2 % H-count check therefore passes even when the two models
have systematically different H positions, giving false assurance. The clashscore delta is the check
that actually sees the difference.

## Applied tolerances

> **Clashscore: |Δ| ≤ 1.0, or 20 % of the mean, whichever is larger** — cctbx vs Richardson
> standalone, **with a matched H-build convention**. Under a mismatched convention (nuclear vs
> electron-cloud) expect 6–23 units of disagreement; that comparison is void, not failed.
>
> **H-placement: H-atom count within ± 0.1 %** (observed max 0.013 %), same Asn/Gln/His flip set, and
> clashscore delta within the clashscore tolerance above. **H-count agreement does not imply
> H-position agreement** — it is nearly insensitive to the convention that dominates the score, so
> it must not be reported as evidence that two H builds match.

The relative term covers 10/10 (24MR needs 17 %); the 1.0 floor keeps low-clashscore models from
being held to an unreasonably tight absolute band.

## Scope limits

- 10 models, clashscore 1.18–13.61. Severely clashing models (≳ 40, the registry's "anomalous"
  band) are not represented; the 20 % relative term is an extrapolation there.
- The Asn/Gln/His **flip set** part of the H-placement tolerance is not measured here — only H count
  and the resulting clashscore. It was measured separately in `tolerance_benchmark_flip_sets.md`,
  using `reduce`'s own `USER  MOD` records: 0 disagreements over 634 residues, because
  `phenix.reduce` **is** the standalone Richardson binary (identical version strings).
- That identity also **re-attributes the matched-convention residual measured above**. Since both
  paths build hydrogens with the same binary, the median 0.115 clashscore difference cannot come from
  H placement; it comes from the clash-counting step (`phenix.clashscore`'s internal analysis vs the
  `probe` summation here). The mismatched-convention result (median 9.95) is unaffected — that
  comparison deliberately changes the H geometry.
- Standalone clashscore is summed by this script from probe output rather than by MolProbity's own
  `clashscore` wrapper (not installed); it was validated against `phenix.clashscore` on 1SAR to
  within 0.34 units.
- One version pair: PHENIX 2.0-5936, reduce 4.16.250520, probe 2.26.021123.
