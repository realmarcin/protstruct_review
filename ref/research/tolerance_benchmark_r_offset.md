# Tolerance benchmark — independent-code-path R offset (gemmi sfcalc vs phenix.model_vs_data)

Settles the only tolerance in `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` whose row admitted its own
magnitude was **unbenchmarked**: "an independent R re-derivation may differ *by a small amount* from
scaling / resolution-binning differences (magnitude **unbenchmarked**)".

Reproduce with:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench_t06_r_offset.py --ids-file <ids.json> --cache <dir> --json <out.json>
```

## Configuration

Both paths start from the same deposited model and the same MTZ:

| | phenix.model_vs_data | gemmi sfcalc |
|---|---|---|
| Fcalc | cctbx FFT, flat-mask bulk solvent | gemmi FFT, flat-mask bulk solvent |
| Scaling | **per-resolution-bin** k_iso / k_aniso / k_mask | **global** k_overall + one anisotropic B, global k_sol / B_sol |
| Mask radii | cctbx set | `--radii-set=cctbx` (matched); gemmi's own default is `vdw` |
| R reported by | the program | summed here: R = Σ‖F_obs‖−‖F_calc‖ / Σ‖F_obs‖ over the work set |

The R summation is done outside both programs on purpose: it is three lines of arithmetic, and
keeping it out means the comparison is between two **Fcalc computations**, not two reporting
conventions. gemmi is *not* a simplified code path — it applies the same flat-mask bulk-solvent and
anisotropic scaling model — so a large offset would indicate a configuration problem, not a
"sophisticated vs simple" difference.

Test set: 15 X-ray entries, 1.20–2.92 Å, R_work 0.127–0.255, work sets of 4.8 k–155 k reflections,
drawn resolution-stratified from RCSB and filtered to entries that deposited **amplitudes** with a
free-flag column.

### Two traps that cost more than the effect being measured

- **Free-flag convention.** Getting it backwards computes R-free and calls it R-work — worth about
  **+0.06** in R, four times the offset being measured. Two conventions occur and both appear in
  this test set: two-valued flags (the minority value marks the test set) and CCP4/REFMAC
  multi-bin flags (10–20 near-equal bins, where bin **0** is the test set). `free_test_value()`
  handles both and returns None rather than guess. Verified against PHENIX's own free count on 11MQ
  (518 reflections with flag 0; PHENIX reported Nfree = 517) and on 12LO (n_work 11025, matching
  PHENIX exactly).
- **Converter choice.** CCP4's `cif2mtz` re-settings the space group for some entries — 11AF's
  deposited `CRYST1` says P 2 21 21, CCP4 writes P 21 21 2 — and `phenix.model_vs_data` then aborts
  on a symmetry mismatch. `gemmi cif2mtz` preserves the deposited setting. The MTZ is also stripped
  to H K L + amplitudes + free flags, because depositions carrying FC/PHIC make model_vs_data abort
  with "Multiple equally suitable arrays of observed xray data found".

|Δ|: **median 0.0069, p90 0.0116, max 0.0151**. Signed: gemmi reads higher in **15 of 15**.

## Findings

**1. "A small amount" is now a number: ~0.007 typical, up to 0.015.** In R-factor terms that is
0.7 percentage points typically and 1.5 at worst — on models whose R_work spans 0.13–0.25, i.e. an
offset of 3–6 % of the value being checked. Large enough that an agent's R re-derivation landing
0.01 from PHENIX is *expected*, not evidence of a modelling error.

**2. The offset is one-sided.** gemmi is higher in 15/15, with no sign changes. The structural
reason is in the table above: PHENIX refits k_iso, k_aniso and k_mask **per resolution bin**, while
`gemmi sfcalc` applies one global scale and one anisotropic tensor. A per-bin fit cannot do worse
than a global one on the same data, so PHENIX's R is systematically the lower number. This is a
fitting-freedom difference, not an accuracy difference — neither R is "the true R".

**3. Mask convention is worth as much as the code difference.** Running gemmi with its own default
`vdw` radii instead of `--radii-set=cctbx` adds a **median +0.0043 and up to +0.014** — comparable
to the entire offset. Any comparison that does not match the mask radii is measuring configuration,
not implementation.

**4. No clean resolution trend.** Median |Δ| runs 0.0057 (< 1.8 Å), 0.0073 (1.8–2.5 Å), 0.0087
(≥ 2.5 Å) — mildly increasing, but the worst case (11MQ, 0.0151) is mid-resolution and coincides
with the largest mask effect, so the driver looks like solvent content rather than resolution.

## Applied tolerance

> **|Δ R| ≤ 0.02**, `gemmi sfcalc --radii-set=cctbx` vs `phenix.model_vs_data`, on the same model,
> the same MTZ and the same work set. Expect gemmi to read **high** — a negative Δ is
> off-distribution. Matching the mask radii set is a **precondition**, not a refinement.

The tightest envelope covering all 15 is 0.016; rounded to 0.02 for margin at n = 15. This replaces
an unquantified "small amount", and it is deliberately not tighter: the two programs differ in
scaling freedom by design.

## Scope limits

- Deposited models scored against their own data. This bounds **tool-vs-tool** disagreement, not how
  much R moves when a model changes.
- Amplitude depositions only; entries depositing intensities are skipped rather than converted,
  since the conversion would add a code path under test.
- `gemmi sfcalc` offers no per-bin scaling, so the offset cannot be reduced by configuring gemmi
  differently — it is structural to the comparison.
- One version pair: PHENIX 2.0-5936 and gemmi 0.7.5.
