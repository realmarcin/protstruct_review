description: Sweep and prioritize the complete protstruct_review GitHub issue queue against current main, scientific records, guards, and repository invariants. Use when asked to review issues, triage the backlog, identify urgent work, or reconcile NEXT_TASKS.md with GitHub. Produces a read-only ranked report by default; it does not close, relabel, comment on, or implement issues unless the user separately asks.

# Review and prioritize open issues

## Purpose and boundary

Sweep the entire open-issue queue, verify each issue against the current default
branch, group overlaps, and produce an evidence-backed priority ranking.
`NEXT_TASKS.md` is a curated working view, not the issue source of truth; compare
it with GitHub but do not treat its contents as proof that an issue is live.

This skill triages work. It is read-only by default and does not implement fixes,
edit `NEXT_TASKS.md`, close or relabel issues, post comments, or maintain a tracker
unless the user explicitly requests that separate mutation.

Before triage, read the repository routing and authority files:

1. `CLAUDE.md`
2. `CODING_STANDARDS.md`
3. `.claude/skills/protstruct-eval/SKILL.md` when scientific claims, oracle
   coverage, QDS output, catalog entries, thresholds, or benchmark records are
   involved

## 1. Establish current state

Refresh and inspect the default branch, local tree, and open PR dependencies:

```bash
git fetch origin
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
gh pr list --repo realmarcin/protstruct_review --state open --limit 5000 \
  --json number,title,baseRefName,headRefName,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,url
```

State whether `main` has moved, whether the tree is clean, and whether any open
PR is based on a non-main branch. An issue implemented only on an unmerged branch
is still open work.

## 2. Fetch the complete issue queue

```bash
queue_file="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/protstruct-review-open-issues.json"
gh issue list --repo realmarcin/protstruct_review --state open --limit 5000 \
  --json number,title,body,labels,comments,createdAt,updatedAt > "$queue_file"
jq -r '.[] | [.number, .createdAt[:10], .title] | @tsv' "$queue_file"
jq length "$queue_file"
```

Read and assess the saved bodies, labels, and comments, not only the title list.
Omitting `--limit` silently samples the first 30. If exactly 5000 rows are
returned, treat coverage as possibly truncated and fetch a higher limit before
claiming a full review.

## 3. Group without hiding issues

Group likely overlaps by shared PR/review origin, file or function, failure mode,
and dependency. Identify umbrella/tracking issues separately from actionable leaf
issues: a tracker inherits the priority of its most urgent live child but is not
itself the next implementation unit.

Keep every issue visible in the report. A grouping is not permission to silently
merge or close issues.

## 4. Verify each issue against current reality

For every open issue, determine whether it is live, fixed/stale, duplicate,
superseded, blocked, or an umbrella.

### Main-branch and PR evidence

- Search only the refreshed default branch for an exact issue reference:

  ```bash
  git log --oneline origin/main --perl-regexp --grep '#<N>\b'
  ```

  Do not use `--all`; unmerged work is not a fix. The word boundary is
  load-bearing because a plain search for `#48` also finds `#480`.
- Query exact linked PRs with:

  ```bash
  gh issue view <N> --repo realmarcin/protstruct_review \
    --json closedByPullRequestsReferences
  gh pr view <PR> --repo realmarcin/protstruct_review --json mergedAt,state,url
  ```

  Do not infer linkage from a bare-number PR search.
- Confirm that cited files, functions, schema fields, generated views, and tests
  still exist in the described form. A moved line number is not itself stale;
  test the underlying claim.

### Scientific and publication evidence

- Recompute quoted counts and figures from committed machine-readable records or
  their committed derivation scripts. Do not accept prose, rounded tables, issue
  labels, or `NEXT_TASKS.md` as the source.
- Check whether a quantitative claim is independently re-measured and whether a
  non-cctbx oracle supports every load-bearing PHENIX result. A PHENIX-grades-
  PHENIX path violates the trust model even when its arithmetic is correct.
- For QDS/emitter issues, test whether scoped or implied content can be silently
  dropped and whether the cross-tool coverage guard fails closed.
- For schema/catalog issues, inspect canonical sources and generated views:
  `ref/catalog.yaml` owns the TSV; `schemas/protstruct_review.yaml` owns
  `protstruct_review/models.py`. Never diagnose drift from a generated file alone.
- Use focused hermetic tests and `uv run --locked -- bash scripts/validate.sh`
  when they materially verify a claim. Do not launch licensed PHENIX/CCP4 runs,
  online fetches, or costly benchmark batches merely to triage. Mark evidence
  that requires an optional external rerun as unverified and explain what is
  missing.

### Guard evidence

For an alleged guard gap, identify the exact malformed input or reverted defect
that would still pass. A test name is not evidence that the behavior is covered.
Prefer an existing negative test or a non-mutating temporary reproduction.

## 5. Assign priority and blockage

Prioritize the consequence, not the age or amount of work.

- **P0 — published correctness, silent corruption, trust, or security.** A wrong
  or unsupported published scientific claim; silent loss or corruption of QDS,
  catalog, schema, or benchmark content; a cross-tool trust violation that can
  reach a verdict; a security defect; or a universally hit crash/hang that blocks
  releases. A guard hole is P0 only when it permits one of these outcomes to pass
  undetected.
- **P1 — real and should be scheduled soon.** A reproducible narrower defect;
  a hermetic-gate or reproducibility failure; a safety-relevant guard gap without
  evidence of current published corruption; authoritative documentation that
  can direct contributors into an invalid workflow; or a process defect with a
  demonstrated near-miss.
- **P2 — maintenance, clarity, or low-risk process.** Publication metadata,
  documentation/readability drift that does not change a scientific conclusion,
  consolidation, cadence policy, minor non-critical test gaps, and cleanup.

Use P0 sparingly and justify it. For each issue state what it blocks: publication,
QDS emission, the hermetic gate, benchmark reproducibility, a later issue, or
nothing immediate. Note dependency order explicitly; prerequisites outrank work
that cannot start safely without them.

## 6. Present the report

Report:

- the exact number of issues reviewed and whether coverage was complete;
- grouped ranked lists, P0 first, with every issue number and a one-sentence
  evidence-based rationale;
- fixed/stale, duplicate, and superseded closure candidates with the specific
  main commit, merged PR, or current-code evidence;
- disagreements between GitHub and `NEXT_TASKS.md`;
- the top two or three actionable leaf issues, in recommended execution order;
- important uncertainty, especially where optional external tools would be
  needed to reproduce a claim.

Do not drop old issues. Age is useful context, not evidence of staleness.

## 7. Mutate only when separately authorized

The review itself never changes GitHub or repository state. If the user later
asks to act:

- confirm exact issue numbers before closing stale or duplicate issues;
- close one issue at a time with a comment citing the verified evidence;
- update an existing umbrella tracker rather than creating a duplicate, after
  verifying that tracker is still open;
- follow `prompts/backlog-loop-goal.md` for implementation: branch before the
  first edit, use a separate read-only adversarial review, file findings before
  fixing them, run the hermetic gate, and pause for explicit merge approval.

## Recurring traps

- A figure recomputed from a rounded presentation instead of its source record.
- A count whose denominator silently changed or is not stated.
- “Independent corroboration” that reused the same code family, binary, or
  inputs.
- A correct arithmetic result promoted into a stronger scientific claim.
- A guard that checks a summary copied from rows rather than re-deriving it.
- One fixed script with an unfixed sibling carrying the same defect.
- A tracking issue ranked as if it were a small actionable patch.
- A result that happens to flatter the hypothesis and therefore receives less
  scrutiny rather than more.
