## Where the tolerance work stands

Thirteen rounds of benchmarking have replaced inferred magnitudes with measured ones. **Every tolerance
in `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` carries `[benchmark]` provenance** (21 rows). Round 6 found that
**two of three "blockers" were wrong** — both mis-invocations rather than limits of a tool. Round 7
then found that **two bands set in rounds 5 and 6 were themselves wrong**, fitted to a narrow
resolution range and breached by null re-refinement once low-resolution entries were included.

Per-tolerance detail lives in the audit trails under `ref/research/tolerance_benchmark_*.md` and in
the re-runnable `scripts/bench_*.py`. It is deliberately **not** duplicated here — a backlog that
accumulates a changelog stops being readable as a backlog.

The pattern held to the end. Tolerances generalised from a single observation — clashscore ±1.0 from
one 1SAR pair; H-count ±0.1 % from one builder in two conventions; the SS floor ≥0.80 from 1SAR
alone; the bond-length attribution by analogy with bond angles; the DockQ and NMR preconditions
asserted with no magnitude at all — **every one moved when measured**. Three moved by more than an
order of magnitude; one (SS agreement) was the wrong *shape* of check entirely; and the §4 bands in
round 5 were breached by re-refining a deposited model against its own data, with no modelling
change at all.

Carry the same suspicion into anything added next: a tolerance that has never been run is a
hypothesis, and in this repo the hypothesis lost 21 times out of 21. Round 6 adds a corollary —
**a "blocked" item is also a hypothesis**. Two of the three blockers dissolved on re-examination:
`reduce2` reports flips once `add_flip_movers=True` is passed (it defaults off), and the §4
false-negative side was testable all along by damaging models rather than refining them.

Round 7 adds the third: **a band this repo measured is a hypothesis too, outside the regime it was
measured in.** Round 8 adds the fourth, and it is about explanations rather than numbers: **a
mechanism inferred from two data points is a hypothesis.** Round 7 explained a degenerate
`d_FSC_model` as a coverage problem on n = 2; round 8 refuted it with four more entries. The number
(1 of 6 entries fails) survived; the story did not.

Round 13 adds a rule about *reading* a band rather than sizing it: **check the clause's direction
before measuring it.** `d_FSC_model` is a resolution, so larger is worse, and the §4 clause says
"did not degrade". Round 12 measured a two-sided `|Δ|` and reported 3 breaches; two of them were
models that got *better*. Under the one-sided band the clause actually specifies, the tolerance
holds on all 28 entries — and the largest change in the whole set, a 36 % improvement, is exactly
the kind of result a symmetric band would have flagged as a failure.

Round 12 adds the counterpart to the headroom rule: **when a band keeps breaking as the set grows,
check its shape before widening it again.** `d_FSC_model` was widened and re-widened as an absolute
± 0.05 Å band and broke anyway at 3 of 21 entries — because the quantity ranges 2.2–6.1 Å and no
absolute band serves both ends. As a **relative** 5 % band the same data has zero violations and a
median of 0.31 %. Rounds 1 and 2 reached the identical conclusion for interface BSA and Wilson B;
it took ten rounds to apply it here.

Round 11 sharpens round 10's lesson into a working rule: **when a band's headroom drops below ~1.2×,
treat it as already broken.** Round 10 measured 1.15× headroom on the §4 Cα band and called CC_mask
the thinnest evidence base in the file; round 11 broke both on the first attempt, CC_mask by more
than 2×. Headroom is a leading indicator, and this repo now has three consecutive rounds of evidence
that it should be acted on rather than noted.

Round 10 adds a sixth, which is really the first one turned on this repo's own work: **a band is
only as good as the last entry added to its set.** Completing the EM set from 2 to 6 entries broke
the CC_mask band that had stood since round 5 — and round 5 had itself flagged that a null
refinement consumed 65 % of it. The warning was in the file for five rounds before the data caught
up with it.

Round 9 closes the earlier thread with the fifth and sharpest: **"unmeasurable" usually means "not yet
read properly".** Four rounds carried `d_FSC_model` as ungateable — blamed on missing half-maps,
then on model-to-map coverage, then on nothing at all. Reading the FSC curve mtriage already writes
took one comparison and showed the tool reports the *first* threshold crossing, which one anomalous
low-resolution shell defeats. The clause was gateable the whole time. The §4 bands held on 19/19 entries at 1.4–2.9 Å and failed on 10/19 once 3.0–3.6 Å
entries were added. Before trusting any band here, check the range of the set it came from — every
benchmark records that in its scope limits for exactly this reason.

## Open

Round 13 broke the CC_mask `< 3.0 Å` branch exactly as predicted — **3 breaks in that tolerance's 4
widenings** (it held once, in round 12) — and found that `d_FSC_model`'s band had been measured in
the wrong direction. The "thinnest band breaks next" heuristic is 3 for 4: it missed round 12, where
the flagged branch held and a different band failed on a shape error instead.

### [ ] Does the CC_mask resolution split still earn its complexity?

After three widenings the two branches are **−0.04** (< 3.0 Å) and **−0.06** (≥ 3.0 Å) — a 1.5×
difference, down from the 3× that justified splitting them in round 11. **A single −0.06 band would
hold on all 28 entries today.**

**Execute:** decide whether to collapse the split. Keeping it costs a resolution lookup and a branch
in every consumer; the evidence for it is now one 0.02 gap between two 14-entry groups whose medians
(+0.0012 and +0.0073) differ by less than either band. Collapsing would also remove the 3.0 Å
boundary question that has consumed two rounds.

### [ ] The `< 3.0 Å` band is again set from one worst case

−0.04 sits just above 9O9K's −0.0311, on 14 entries. That is the same construction that has broken
three times running for this tolerance. Not worth pre-emptively widening — the point of the
benchmark is to measure, not to guess — but it should be the first thing re-tested when EM entries
are added, and it is flagged here so a passing result is not mistaken for a settled one.

### [ ] The one-sided `d_FSC_model` band rests on a thin tail

28 entries produce only **8 degradations**, of which exactly one exceeds 1.1 % (9VAM, 4.28 %). The
5 % band is therefore set from a single observation again, even though the entry count looks
healthy. Splitting measurements by direction — as round 13 had to — halves the usable evidence for
any one-sided band, which is worth remembering when reading the other §4 clauses.

## Not actionable in this repo (listed so the gaps are explained, not recommended)

- **ctruncate Wilson-plot fit range** (residual confound from #19): the fit ranges were not matched
  because ctruncate does not report the range it used, so the measured 13.7 % is an upper bound on
  estimator divergence. Needs a ctruncate that reports or accepts an explicit range. *Partial local
  probe:* re-run `phenix.xtriage` with a restricted low-resolution cutoff to bound how much of the
  gap is range choice — worth doing only if the Wilson-B tolerance becomes load-bearing.
- **L-test matched resolution range**: the same shape, and confirmed unachievable — ctruncate
  restricts the L-test by a median 0.46 Å and its usage line exposes no resolution flag. Recorded as
  a caveat on the tolerance rather than a gate.
- **Fragment guard is `SSBOND`-only** (from #25): a cleaved molecule held together by something other
  than a disulfide, or an entry omitting `SSBOND` records, would not be caught. Extending it needs
  RCSB entity annotations rather than the coordinate file alone.
- **T16 BSA covers protein–protein only**: nucleic-acid and protein–ligand interfaces are out of
  scope for the tolerance as written (protein-only atom selection).
- **T17 independent NMR oracle**: no local wwPDB NMR validation / PROCHECK-NMR / RPF install;
  deposited validation reports are fetched per entry. A deliberate gap in `ref/oracle_tools.md`.
- **ChimeraX (T01, T08), MoRDa (T09), STRIDE (T15)**: recorded deliberate gaps; install only if those
  tasks become regression targets. **STRIDE is worth more now than before**: it is a third SS
  assigner, and round 4 could not tell whether DSSP or P-SEA is the outlier when they disagree.
