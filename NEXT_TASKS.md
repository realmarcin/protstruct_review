**Last reconciled: 2026-07-31** (round 18). No open GitHub issues; PR
[#69](https://github.com/realmarcin/protstruct_review/pull/69) open for this round. There is no CI in
this repo — `bash scripts/validate.sh` is the gate, and it must exit 0 before a merge.

## Where the tolerance work stands

Eighteen rounds of benchmarking have replaced inferred magnitudes with measured ones. **Every
tolerance in `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` carries `[benchmark]` provenance** — **20 rows, not
the 21 quoted here since round 5** (CC_mask and `d_FSC_model` share one row). Round 17's audit found
**7 of those 20 quote a figure from a set that can no longer be reconstructed**, and marked them
`⚠ partial record`. Round 18 fixed the cause: **every `bench_*.py` now commits the set it ran on**,
and `scripts/validate.sh` fails if one does not.

Round 6 found that
**two of three "blockers" were wrong** — both mis-invocations rather than limits of a tool. Round 7
then found that **two bands set in rounds 5 and 6 were themselves wrong**, fitted to a narrow
resolution range and breached by null re-refinement once low-resolution entries were included.

Per-tolerance detail lives in the audit trails under `ref/research/tolerance_benchmark_*.md` and in
the re-runnable `scripts/bench_*.py`. It is deliberately **not** duplicated here — a backlog that
accumulates a changelog stops being readable as a backlog.

**Lessons live in [`ref/research/lessons.md`](ref/research/lessons.md)** — eighteen rounds of
rules about how these tolerances fail, extracted so this file stays readable as a backlog (#65).
Record new ones there. The operative few, for anyone about to add a tolerance or widen a band:

- **A tolerance that has never been run is a hypothesis** — it lost 21 times out of 21 here. So is a
  "blocked" item, a measured band outside its measured regime, and a mechanism from two data points.
- **Register the prediction before the data.** It changed the outcome twice in round 15 alone.
- **Count what the clause can actually be broken by.** A one-sided band gains nothing from an
  improvement, so a round can raise every count in the tolerance row while strengthening nothing.
- **Check the clause's direction and shape before sizing it.** Two rounds were spent widening a band
  that was the wrong shape, and one reported improvements as breaches.
- **Record every entry, not the interesting ones.** A partial history does not just lose evidence, it
  biases the priors built on what survives — and four entries counted in the published totals are now
  unidentifiable. `scripts/validate.sh` gates that each round leaves its lesson here.
- **Check the power before hunting the mechanism.** Mechanism hunts are 0 for 3 here. Round 17's
  gate showed the phenomenon it was asked to explain (4/8 vs 1/9) is p = 0.131 — the question needed
  ~20 entries per arm and the rounds build 8.
- **Registering a prediction does not protect you from registering a bad test.** Round 17's P2 held
  as registered and was still wrong, because correlating a change against its own baseline is
  negatively biased by construction. Name the test's artefacts *in* the registration.
- **Confirm a suspected gap by running, not by reading.** Round 17 marked the DockQ row partial from
  a `limit=8` in the code; re-running showed the cap was never reached and the record was complete.
- **When the set grows, re-test every clause it backs.** Rounds 8/10/11 grew the §4 X-ray set
  19 → 37 while re-testing only two of its four clauses; the other two have been untested since
  round 7.

## Open

Round 18 executed the whole round-17 backlog. Three items closed outright; the fourth turned out to
be a bigger finding than a stale number and is re-opened in sharper form.

**Closed.** Every `bench_*.py` now commits its entry set, gated by `scripts/validate.sh`. Both rows
marked "recoverable" were re-run: **bond-angle** was a real gap and is now a full record (all 17
models, every published figure reproduced), **DockQ** was never partial at all and its mark is
withdrawn. Fetch-stage attrition and the charge inventory are durable in
`ref/research/data/em_fetch_attrition.tsv`. **The registry is 13 rows fully backed, 7 marked partial.**

### [ ] Re-measure the two §4 clauses that have been untested since round 7

Round 18 diagnosed the "19 vs 37" discrepancy and it is not a stale count. The ΔRMSD row is correct;
rounds 8, 10 and 11 grew the X-ray set 19 → 26 → 32 → 37 while re-testing **only** the Cα-shift and
favored clauses. So:

- `rotamer outliers_post ≤ outliers_pre + 4 pp` (quoted `0/19`, worst rise 3.60 pp)
- the `clashscore_post / clashscore_pre ≥ 5×` gate (quoted max 4.26×, starting clashscore up to 17.2)

**have not been checked against the 18 entries added since round 7**, and both worst cases come from
the original 8. The "19 is really the `< 2.5 Å` branch" reading is ruled out — neither clause was ever
resolution-split.

**Scope this honestly before running it.** Only **16 of the 37** entries are identifiable, so a run
is a *new measurement on a smaller set*, not a re-validation. It would still be worth doing: 16 named
entries beats 8, and either clause could have been breached at any point in eleven rounds. Report it
as a new measurement with its own denominator, and do not restate the old figures as confirmed.

### [ ] Decide whether the four irrecoverable sets get re-measured or retired

Four benchmarks are short of their published denominators and now say so in the script
(`SET_IS_COMPLETE = False`): flip-sets 12/17, vs-deposited 11/17, X-ray §4 16/37, L-test 5/27. Marking
them was the honest move; it is not a resolution. Each needs a decision:

- **Re-measure** on a fresh, committed set and replace the figure — costly, but ends the ambiguity.
- **Retire** the un-backed figure and quote only what the recoverable subset supports.

The L-test is the clearest candidate for the second: its **twin/no-twin call agreed 27/27** and that
is the load-bearing half of the tolerance, so the unrecoverable part (median |Δ| 0.006, max 0.047)
could be demoted to a caveat without weakening the gate.

## Not actionable in this repo (listed so the gaps are explained, not recommended)

- **ctruncate Wilson-plot fit range** (residual confound from #19): the fit ranges were not matched
  because ctruncate does not report the range it used, so the measured 13.7 % is an upper bound on
  estimator divergence. Needs a ctruncate that reports or accepts an explicit range. *Partial local
  probe:* re-run `phenix.xtriage` with a restricted low-resolution cutoff to bound how much of the
  gap is range choice — worth doing only if the Wilson-B tolerance becomes load-bearing.
- **L-test matched resolution range**: the same shape, and confirmed unachievable — ctruncate
  restricts the L-test by a median 0.46 Å and its usage line exposes no resolution flag. Recorded as
  a caveat on the tolerance rather than a gate.
- **Fragment guard is `SSBOND`-only** (from #25): a cleaved molecule held together by something other
  than a disulfide, or an entry omitting `SSBOND` records, would not be caught. Extending it needs
  RCSB entity annotations rather than the coordinate file alone.
- **T16 BSA covers protein–protein only**: nucleic-acid and protein–ligand interfaces are out of
  scope for the tolerance as written (protein-only atom selection).
- **T17 independent NMR oracle**: no local wwPDB NMR validation / PROCHECK-NMR / RPF install;
  deposited validation reports are fetched per entry. A deliberate gap in `ref/oracle_tools.md`.
- **ChimeraX (T01, T08), MoRDa (T09), STRIDE (T15)**: recorded deliberate gaps; install only if those
  tasks become regression targets. **STRIDE is worth more now than before**: it is a third SS
  assigner, and round 4 could not tell whether DSSP or P-SEA is the outlier when they disagree.

## Other tracked work

- **GitHub #2** *(closed — informational)*: driving examples complete (17/17).
- **GitHub #3** *(closed — informational)*: T15/T16/T17 runnable; only web/report-blocked pieces remain.
- **GitHub #18, #19** *(closed 2026-07-25, PR #24)*: the two provisional tolerances.
- **GitHub #25, #26, #27** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #24)*: intramolecular fragment pairs counted as
  interfaces, cache written into the working tree, multi-block sf-cifs.
- **GitHub #29, #30, #31** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #28)*: two-block `model_vs_data` logs and outlier
  asymmetry, the near-identical-pairs weakness in the CA RMSD floor, dead code.
- **GitHub #33, #34, #35** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #32)*: subset-dependent library share,
  unknown-vs-mismatched L-test ranges, and the het-dictionary difference that exposed a wrong
  H-count tolerance.
- **GitHub #37, #38** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #36)*: the Ramachandran 0.00-vs-0.00 evidence base, and
  the SS-agreement metric being degenerate at the bad end.
- **GitHub #57** *(closed 2026-07-27, PR #56)*: a self-review finding — the round-13 write-up claimed
  a "fifth consecutive round" of thinnest-band failures when the record is 3 breaks in 4 widenings,
  round 12 having held. Logged because the correction changed a stated rule of thumb, not just a
  number: the heuristic is 3 for 4, and its one miss was a band of the wrong *shape* rather than the
  wrong size — a failure mode headroom does not track.
- **GitHub #59** *(closed 2026-07-28, PR #58)*: the round-11 "below 1.2× headroom, treat as already
  broken" rule, back-tested and found not to hold — breaks at 1.15×, 1.44× and 1.55× while the one
  band that survived two rounds of set growth sat at 1.26×. Logged because it retired a *lesson*, not
  a tolerance: the rule was generalised from one observation and never re-tested.
- **GitHub #61** *(closed 2026-07-28, PR #60)*: degradation frequency and magnitude conflated, which
  had inverted a widening recommendation. Degradation is more frequent below 3.0 Å (4/8 vs 5/14) but
  3–7× larger above it; only magnitude re-fits a band. Round 15 then confirmed the corrected version.
- **GitHub #63** *(closed 2026-07-29, PR #62)*: "14 CC_mask degradations" stated as a count when it is
  a lower bound (14–19) — round 13 published only its branch minimum. Logged because the degradation
  count is now the headline evidence measure, so an unverifiable figure there is not an improvement on
  an inflated one.
