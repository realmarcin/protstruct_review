**Last reconciled: 2026-07-30** (round 17). No open GitHub issues, no open PRs. There is no CI in this
repo — `bash scripts/validate.sh` is the gate, and it must exit 0 before a merge.

## Where the tolerance work stands

Seventeen rounds of benchmarking have replaced inferred magnitudes with measured ones. **Every
tolerance in `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` carries `[benchmark]` provenance** — **20 rows, not
the 21 quoted here since round 5** (CC_mask and `d_FSC_model` share one row). Round 17's audit found
**7 of those 20 quote a figure from a set that can no longer be reconstructed**, and marked them
`⚠ partial record`.

Round 6 found that
**two of three "blockers" were wrong** — both mis-invocations rather than limits of a tool. Round 7
then found that **two bands set in rounds 5 and 6 were themselves wrong**, fitted to a narrow
resolution range and breached by null re-refinement once low-resolution entries were included.

Per-tolerance detail lives in the audit trails under `ref/research/tolerance_benchmark_*.md` and in
the re-runnable `scripts/bench_*.py`. It is deliberately **not** duplicated here — a backlog that
accumulates a changelog stops being readable as a backlog.

**Lessons live in [`ref/research/lessons.md`](ref/research/lessons.md)** — seventeen rounds of
rules about how these tolerances fail, extracted so this file stays readable as a backlog (#65).
Record new ones there. The operative few, for anyone about to add a tolerance or widen a band:

- **A tolerance that has never been run is a hypothesis** — it lost 21 times out of 21 here. So is a
  "blocked" item, a measured band outside its measured regime, and a mechanism from two data points.
- **Register the prediction before the data.** It changed the outcome twice in round 15 alone.
- **Count what the clause can actually be broken by.** A one-sided band gains nothing from an
  improvement, so a round can raise every count in the tolerance row while strengthening nothing.
- **Check the clause's direction and shape before sizing it.** Two rounds were spent widening a band
  that was the wrong shape, and one reported improvements as breaches.
- **Record every entry, not the interesting ones.** A partial history does not just lose evidence, it
  biases the priors built on what survives — and four entries counted in the published totals are now
  unidentifiable. `scripts/validate.sh` gates that each round leaves its lesson here.
- **Check the power before hunting the mechanism.** Mechanism hunts are 0 for 3 here. Round 17's
  gate showed the phenomenon it was asked to explain (4/8 vs 1/9) is p = 0.131 — the question needed
  ~20 entries per arm and the rounds build 8.
- **Registering a prediction does not protect you from registering a bad test.** Round 17's P2 held
  as registered and was still wrong, because correlating a change against its own baseline is
  negatively biased by construction. Name the test's artefacts *in* the registration.

## Open

Round 17 executed all four items from the round-16 backlog. Two produced the answer asked for, and
two produced a different answer than expected — the mechanism hunt found there was nothing to
explain, and the 10BU re-run confirmed the entry while correcting the number.

**All four previous items are closed.** The `d_FSC_model` worst case is now **+4.786 %** (10BU,
verified by a byte-identical re-run; the old +4.787 % was a backfill rounding artefact), the ligand
skip is screened at fetch time, the registry has been audited, and the CC_mask rate question is
closed as underpowered rather than answered.

**The CC_mask degradation *rate* item is retired, not deferred.** Fisher's exact on 4/8 vs 1/9 gives
**p = 0.131**; the comparison needs **~20 entries per arm** and rounds build 8–9. Do not open it
again without that sample size. Magnitude remains fittable and is where band work should go.

### [ ] Commit the entry set each bench script runs on

The round-17 audit found **7 of 20 `[benchmark]` rows quote a figure from a set that cannot be
reconstructed**, and the cause is systemic: only `bench_t01_superposition.py`,
`bench_t15_ss_agreement.py`, `bench_t16_bsa_vs_pisa.py` and `bench_t16_dockq_mapping.py` hardcode
their entries. The rest take `--ids-file <ids.json>` or glob an uncommitted cache, and **no
`ids.json` is committed anywhere in this repo.** Where a row survives, it survives because an author
happened to paste a table into the audit trail.

**Execute:** give every `bench_*.py` a hardcoded `DEFAULT_SET`, backfilled from the trail tables
where those exist. That converts "recoverable by accident" into "recoverable by re-running", which is
what `[benchmark]` provenance already claims. Where no table exists, the set is gone — record that
rather than inventing one.

### [ ] Recover the two rows marked recoverable

Cheap, and it removes two marks:

- **Bond-angle RMSD** — no per-entry angle value was ever published, but the set is the same 17
  models as bond-length RMSD and `bench_t05_restraint_library.py` already computes per-entry angle
  figures into its `--json`. Re-run and publish the table.
- **DockQ** — `DEFAULT_SET` is hardcoded and the mapping enumeration is deterministic, so the
  un-printed mappings regenerate. The trail shows 6 of up to 8 per complex.

### [ ] Re-validate the §4 geometry row against the 37-entry set

The geometry Δ row says **19 entries**; the ΔRMSD row directly above it says **37**. They describe
the same benchmark, so one was not re-validated when the set grew. Its quoted maxima (favored null
max 5.26 pp, clashscore ratio max 4.26×) set band widths, so a stale denominator there is
load-bearing. Note this row is also `⚠ partial record` — the ~11 low-resolution entries producing
those maxima are named nowhere, so re-validation may mean re-measuring rather than recounting.

### [ ] Make fetch-stage attrition and the charge inventory durable

`em_refinement_deltas.tsv` records attrition from the refinement stage onward. An entry rejected at
fetch time — by the charge screen, the new ligand screen, or a size cap — is recorded only in the
fetch run's JSON, inside a temporary cache. **10GJ, 10GK, 10GL and 10GM were found on disk in round
14's cache carrying an unparameterised ligand and appear in no durable record at all.**

The same applies to the charge inventory. Round 16 recorded a publication-clustering hypothesis for
the `O1-` failures and noted the inventory was "stored on every kept entry so a future round can test
it" — it is stored in `entries.json`, which does not survive the round. This is the round-13 failure
in a new place: the *screens* now work, and their output is not being kept.

## Not actionable in this repo (listed so the gaps are explained, not recommended)

- **ctruncate Wilson-plot fit range** (residual confound from #19): the fit ranges were not matched
  because ctruncate does not report the range it used, so the measured 13.7 % is an upper bound on
  estimator divergence. Needs a ctruncate that reports or accepts an explicit range. *Partial local
  probe:* re-run `phenix.xtriage` with a restricted low-resolution cutoff to bound how much of the
  gap is range choice — worth doing only if the Wilson-B tolerance becomes load-bearing.
- **L-test matched resolution range**: the same shape, and confirmed unachievable — ctruncate
  restricts the L-test by a median 0.46 Å and its usage line exposes no resolution flag. Recorded as
  a caveat on the tolerance rather than a gate.
- **Fragment guard is `SSBOND`-only** (from #25): a cleaved molecule held together by something other
  than a disulfide, or an entry omitting `SSBOND` records, would not be caught. Extending it needs
  RCSB entity annotations rather than the coordinate file alone.
- **T16 BSA covers protein–protein only**: nucleic-acid and protein–ligand interfaces are out of
  scope for the tolerance as written (protein-only atom selection).
- **T17 independent NMR oracle**: no local wwPDB NMR validation / PROCHECK-NMR / RPF install;
  deposited validation reports are fetched per entry. A deliberate gap in `ref/oracle_tools.md`.
- **ChimeraX (T01, T08), MoRDa (T09), STRIDE (T15)**: recorded deliberate gaps; install only if those
  tasks become regression targets. **STRIDE is worth more now than before**: it is a third SS
  assigner, and round 4 could not tell whether DSSP or P-SEA is the outlier when they disagree.

## Other tracked work

- **GitHub #2** *(closed — informational)*: driving examples complete (17/17).
- **GitHub #3** *(closed — informational)*: T15/T16/T17 runnable; only web/report-blocked pieces remain.
- **GitHub #18, #19** *(closed 2026-07-25, PR #24)*: the two provisional tolerances.
- **GitHub #25, #26, #27** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #24)*: intramolecular fragment pairs counted as
  interfaces, cache written into the working tree, multi-block sf-cifs.
- **GitHub #29, #30, #31** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #28)*: two-block `model_vs_data` logs and outlier
  asymmetry, the near-identical-pairs weakness in the CA RMSD floor, dead code.
- **GitHub #33, #34, #35** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #32)*: subset-dependent library share,
  unknown-vs-mismatched L-test ranges, and the het-dictionary difference that exposed a wrong
  H-count tolerance.
- **GitHub #37, #38** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #36)*: the Ramachandran 0.00-vs-0.00 evidence base, and
  the SS-agreement metric being degenerate at the bad end.
- **GitHub #57** *(closed 2026-07-27, PR #56)*: a self-review finding — the round-13 write-up claimed
  a "fifth consecutive round" of thinnest-band failures when the record is 3 breaks in 4 widenings,
  round 12 having held. Logged because the correction changed a stated rule of thumb, not just a
  number: the heuristic is 3 for 4, and its one miss was a band of the wrong *shape* rather than the
  wrong size — a failure mode headroom does not track.
- **GitHub #59** *(closed 2026-07-28, PR #58)*: the round-11 "below 1.2× headroom, treat as already
  broken" rule, back-tested and found not to hold — breaks at 1.15×, 1.44× and 1.55× while the one
  band that survived two rounds of set growth sat at 1.26×. Logged because it retired a *lesson*, not
  a tolerance: the rule was generalised from one observation and never re-tested.
- **GitHub #61** *(closed 2026-07-28, PR #60)*: degradation frequency and magnitude conflated, which
  had inverted a widening recommendation. Degradation is more frequent below 3.0 Å (4/8 vs 5/14) but
  3–7× larger above it; only magnitude re-fits a band. Round 15 then confirmed the corrected version.
- **GitHub #63** *(closed 2026-07-29, PR #62)*: "14 CC_mask degradations" stated as a count when it is
  a lower bound (14–19) — round 13 published only its branch minimum. Logged because the degradation
  count is now the headline evidence measure, so an unverifiable figure there is not an improvement on
  an inflated one.
