## Where the tolerance work stands

Fifteen rounds of benchmarking have replaced inferred magnitudes with measured ones. **Every tolerance
in `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` carries `[benchmark]` provenance** (21 rows). Round 6 found that
**two of three "blockers" were wrong** — both mis-invocations rather than limits of a tool. Round 7
then found that **two bands set in rounds 5 and 6 were themselves wrong**, fitted to a narrow
resolution range and breached by null re-refinement once low-resolution entries were included.

Per-tolerance detail lives in the audit trails under `ref/research/tolerance_benchmark_*.md` and in
the re-runnable `scripts/bench_*.py`. It is deliberately **not** duplicated here — a backlog that
accumulates a changelog stops being readable as a backlog.

**Lessons live in [`ref/research/lessons.md`](ref/research/lessons.md)** — fifteen rounds of
rules about how these tolerances fail, extracted so this file stays readable as a backlog (#65).
Record new ones there. The operative few, for anyone about to add a tolerance or widen a band:

- **A tolerance that has never been run is a hypothesis** — it lost 21 times out of 21 here. So is a
  "blocked" item, a measured band outside its measured regime, and a mechanism from two data points.
- **Register the prediction before the data.** It changed the outcome twice in round 15 alone.
- **Count what the clause can actually be broken by.** A one-sided band gains nothing from an
  improvement, so a round can raise every count in the tolerance row while strengthening nothing.
- **Check the clause's direction and shape before sizing it.** Two rounds were spent widening a band
  that was the wrong shape, and one reported improvements as breaches.

## Open

Round 15 widened at 3.0–4.0 Å with **predictions registered before the data**, after round 14 had to
label its own p-values as computed post hoc. Four of six held.

| # | Prediction | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | ≥ 1 entry degrades | ✅ 4 did |
| P2 | largest degradation > 0.0139 | ✅ 0.0351, 2.5× |
| P3 | −0.06 band holds | ✅ 1.71× headroom |
| P4 | rate nearer 36 % than 0 % | ✅ 50 % |
| P5/P6 | cluster-mates behave alike | ❌ **both falsified** |

**P2 was the round's real test.** The rationale for widening low rather than high — that degradations
there are large enough to re-fit a band — is confirmed, so round 14's frequency/magnitude correction
was right and the resolution split is better evidenced than before.

**P5/P6 cost a finding.** Mid-round I claimed the evidence base was smaller than round 14 said,
because 22 entries came from 12 publications and the four largest degradations arrived as same-paper
pairs. Both registered tests failed — the peptidase cluster produced **opposite signs on the same
protein** — and a permutation test put within-cluster agreement at **p = 0.38**. Withdrawn, per the
rule registered before the test ran. Round 14's count argument is untouched; only the further
deflation from ~9 to ~6 is gone.

### [ ] `d_FSC_model` has 1.045× headroom — the thinnest margin in the file

10BU degraded it by **+4.79 %** against a **5 %** band, displacing 9VAM's +4.28 %. **Any future
degradation above 4.79 % breaks it.**

Deliberately **not** widened: it holds with 0 breaches, and this series does not move bands on
anticipation. But it is now the first thing to re-test, ahead of CC_mask — which is the reversal of
where attention has been for six rounds. P3 was registered about CC_mask because that tolerance has
all the breakage history; it came through at 1.71× while the quantity nobody was watching nearly
broke.

**Execute:** the next EM widening should be sized to produce `d_FSC_model` degradations specifically.
Note that CC_mask and `d_FSC_model` can move in **opposite directions** on one refinement (10RI), so a
set chosen to stress one does not automatically stress the other.

### [ ] Entry attrition is systematic, at ~17 %

Three of 18 attempted entries across rounds 14–15 were unprocessable: 11MR and 10EG (unparameterised
ligands, 128 and 195 atoms), 10EN (`O1-` outside the electron scattering table). These are entry
properties, not tool failures, and they bias the set toward chemically simple structures every run.

**Execute:** quantify whether ligand-bearing entries differ in Δ, or record the bias as permanent in
the tolerance row. Currently the direction is unknown, only the existence is.

### [ ] Both CC_mask bands are still set from single worst cases

−0.04 above 9O9K's −0.0311 and −0.06 above 9UPM's −0.0475. Round 15 added 4 degradations to the
`≥ 3.0 Å` branch but none exceeded −0.0351, so the worst case is unchanged and the band is untested at
its edge.

### [ ] Recover per-entry values for rounds 5 and 9–13 — now a prerequisite, not housekeeping

Round 15 hit this gap twice. The permutation test could only use 30 of 44 entries, and **the headline
CC_mask degradation count cannot be stated as a number at all** — round 13 published only its branch
minimum, so 5 of its entries have no recorded Δ and the total is a range, 14–19 (#63).

Since round 14 established that the degradation count *is* the evidence measure for a one-sided band,
not being able to state it is a direct limit on every claim built on it.

**Execute:** re-run rounds 5 and 9–13's entries through `bench_refinement_deltas_em.py`, now that
`fetch_em_entries.py` can rebuild the cache. The entry lists survive in the audit trails even though
the per-entry values do not.

## Not actionable in this repo (listed so the gaps are explained, not recommended)

- **ctruncate Wilson-plot fit range** (residual confound from #19): the fit ranges were not matched
  because ctruncate does not report the range it used, so the measured 13.7 % is an upper bound on
  estimator divergence. Needs a ctruncate that reports or accepts an explicit range. *Partial local
  probe:* re-run `phenix.xtriage` with a restricted low-resolution cutoff to bound how much of the
  gap is range choice — worth doing only if the Wilson-B tolerance becomes load-bearing.
- **L-test matched resolution range**: the same shape, and confirmed unachievable — ctruncate
  restricts the L-test by a median 0.46 Å and its usage line exposes no resolution flag. Recorded as
  a caveat on the tolerance rather than a gate.
- **Fragment guard is `SSBOND`-only** (from #25): a cleaved molecule held together by something other
  than a disulfide, or an entry omitting `SSBOND` records, would not be caught. Extending it needs
  RCSB entity annotations rather than the coordinate file alone.
- **T16 BSA covers protein–protein only**: nucleic-acid and protein–ligand interfaces are out of
  scope for the tolerance as written (protein-only atom selection).
- **T17 independent NMR oracle**: no local wwPDB NMR validation / PROCHECK-NMR / RPF install;
  deposited validation reports are fetched per entry. A deliberate gap in `ref/oracle_tools.md`.
- **ChimeraX (T01, T08), MoRDa (T09), STRIDE (T15)**: recorded deliberate gaps; install only if those
  tasks become regression targets. **STRIDE is worth more now than before**: it is a third SS
  assigner, and round 4 could not tell whether DSSP or P-SEA is the outlier when they disagree.

- **GitHub #33, #34, #35** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #32)*: subset-dependent library share,
  unknown-vs-mismatched L-test ranges, and the het-dictionary difference that exposed a wrong
  H-count tolerance.
- **GitHub #37, #38** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #36)*: the Ramachandran 0.00-vs-0.00 evidence base, and
  the SS-agreement metric being degenerate at the bad end.
- **GitHub #57** *(closed 2026-07-27, PR #56)*: a self-review finding — the round-13 write-up claimed
  a "fifth consecutive round" of thinnest-band failures when the record is 3 breaks in 4 widenings,
  round 12 having held. Logged because the correction changed a stated rule of thumb, not just a
  number: the heuristic is 3 for 4, and its one miss was a band of the wrong *shape* rather than the
  wrong size — a failure mode headroom does not track.
- **GitHub #59** *(closed 2026-07-28, PR #58)*: the round-11 "below 1.2× headroom, treat as already
  broken" rule, back-tested and found not to hold — breaks at 1.15×, 1.44× and 1.55× while the one
  band that survived two rounds of set growth sat at 1.26×. Logged because it retired a *lesson*, not
  a tolerance: the rule was generalised from one observation and never re-tested.
- **GitHub #61** *(closed 2026-07-28, PR #60)*: degradation frequency and magnitude conflated, which
  had inverted a widening recommendation. Degradation is more frequent below 3.0 Å (4/8 vs 5/14) but
  3–7× larger above it; only magnitude re-fits a band. Round 15 then confirmed the corrected version.
- **GitHub #63** *(closed 2026-07-29, PR #62)*: "14 CC_mask degradations" stated as a count when it is
  a lower bound (14–19) — round 13 published only its branch minimum. Logged because the degradation
  count is now the headline evidence measure, so an unverifiable figure there is not an improvement on
  an inflated one.
