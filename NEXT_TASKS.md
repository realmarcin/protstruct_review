## Where the tolerance work stands

Eleven rounds of benchmarking have replaced inferred magnitudes with measured ones. **Every tolerance
in `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` carries `[benchmark]` provenance** (21 rows). Round 6 found that
**two of three "blockers" were wrong** — both mis-invocations rather than limits of a tool. Round 7
then found that **two bands set in rounds 5 and 6 were themselves wrong**, fitted to a narrow
resolution range and breached by null re-refinement once low-resolution entries were included.

Per-tolerance detail lives in the audit trails under `ref/research/tolerance_benchmark_*.md` and in
the re-runnable `scripts/bench_*.py`. It is deliberately **not** duplicated here — a backlog that
accumulates a changelog stops being readable as a backlog.

The pattern held to the end. Tolerances generalised from a single observation — clashscore ±1.0 from
one 1SAR pair; H-count ±0.1 % from one builder in two conventions; the SS floor ≥0.80 from 1SAR
alone; the bond-length attribution by analogy with bond angles; the DockQ and NMR preconditions
asserted with no magnitude at all — **every one moved when measured**. Three moved by more than an
order of magnitude; one (SS agreement) was the wrong *shape* of check entirely; and the §4 bands in
round 5 were breached by re-refining a deposited model against its own data, with no modelling
change at all.

Carry the same suspicion into anything added next: a tolerance that has never been run is a
hypothesis, and in this repo the hypothesis lost 21 times out of 21. Round 6 adds a corollary —
**a "blocked" item is also a hypothesis**. Two of the three blockers dissolved on re-examination:
`reduce2` reports flips once `add_flip_movers=True` is passed (it defaults off), and the §4
false-negative side was testable all along by damaging models rather than refining them.

Round 7 adds the third: **a band this repo measured is a hypothesis too, outside the regime it was
measured in.** Round 8 adds the fourth, and it is about explanations rather than numbers: **a
mechanism inferred from two data points is a hypothesis.** Round 7 explained a degenerate
`d_FSC_model` as a coverage problem on n = 2; round 8 refuted it with four more entries. The number
(1 of 6 entries fails) survived; the story did not.

Round 11 sharpens round 10's lesson into a working rule: **when a band's headroom drops below ~1.2×,
treat it as already broken.** Round 10 measured 1.15× headroom on the §4 Cα band and called CC_mask
the thinnest evidence base in the file; round 11 broke both on the first attempt, CC_mask by more
than 2×. Headroom is a leading indicator, and this repo now has three consecutive rounds of evidence
that it should be acted on rather than noted.

Round 10 adds a sixth, which is really the first one turned on this repo's own work: **a band is
only as good as the last entry added to its set.** Completing the EM set from 2 to 6 entries broke
the CC_mask band that had stood since round 5 — and round 5 had itself flagged that a null
refinement consumed 65 % of it. The warning was in the file for five rounds before the data caught
up with it.

Round 9 closes the earlier thread with the fifth and sharpest: **"unmeasurable" usually means "not yet
read properly".** Four rounds carried `d_FSC_model` as ungateable — blamed on missing half-maps,
then on model-to-map coverage, then on nothing at all. Reading the FSC curve mtriage already writes
took one comparison and showed the tool reports the *first* threshold crossing, which one anomalous
low-resolution shell defeats. The clause was gateable the whole time. The §4 bands held on 19/19 entries at 1.4–2.9 Å and failed on 10/19 once 3.0–3.6 Å
entries were added. Before trusting any band here, check the range of the set it came from — every
benchmark records that in its scope limits for exactly this reason.

## Open

Round 11 broke both bands round 10 had flagged, on the first try. The rotamer item — closed as a
dead end in rounds 8 and 10 — turned out to have an independent library after all.

### [ ] `d_FSC_model` is the next band to break

Headroom fell from **5× to 1.55×** when the EM set went 6 → 12 entries (max |Δ| 0.0094 → 0.0322 Å
against ± 0.05 Å). That is the same trajectory CC_mask and the §4 Cα band followed immediately
before breaking. Expect it to breach on the next widening, and treat a pass as weak evidence.

**Execute:** add EM entries and re-derive. Note the estimator contributes some of this Δ
(round 10, issue #51), so separate estimator jitter from refinement effect before widening.

### [ ] CC_mask `≥ 3.0 Å` branch rests on 6 entries

The new resolution-conditional band is `− 0.02` below 3.0 Å and `− 0.06` at or above. The upper
branch has 6 entries, one of which (−0.0475) sets it. **This band has now broken twice in
consecutive rounds** — −0.01 set on 2 entries broke at 6, −0.02 broke at 13 — so a third break is
the base case, not a surprise.

Also unmeasured: nothing lies between **2.97 and 3.07 Å**, so the 3.0 Å split point separates the
observed groups but is not itself located.

### [ ] Rotamer favored % — measurable comparison still absent

Round 11 established that an independent library exists (CCP4 monomer library chi targets via
`gemmi rmsz`) and that it ranks sidechains the same way MolProbity does — median torsion |Z| 1.50 /
3.30 / 4.33 for Favored / Allowed / OUTLIER. That is corroboration, not a measurement: the two
answer different questions and cannot be differenced into a favored-% tolerance.

Still open if it matters: **chi2–chi4** were never compared (only chi1, verified to 0.05°), and no
implementation produces a favored/allowed *percentage* from a non-MolProbity library.

## Not actionable in this repo (listed so the gaps are explained, not recommended)

- **ctruncate Wilson-plot fit range** (residual confound from #19): the fit ranges were not matched
  because ctruncate does not report the range it used, so the measured 13.7 % is an upper bound on
  estimator divergence. Needs a ctruncate that reports or accepts an explicit range. *Partial local
  probe:* re-run `phenix.xtriage` with a restricted low-resolution cutoff to bound how much of the
  gap is range choice — worth doing only if the Wilson-B tolerance becomes load-bearing.
- **L-test matched resolution range**: the same shape, and confirmed unachievable — ctruncate
  restricts the L-test by a median 0.46 Å and its usage line exposes no resolution flag. Recorded as
  a caveat on the tolerance rather than a gate.
- **Fragment guard is `SSBOND`-only** (from #25): a cleaved molecule held together by something other
  than a disulfide, or an entry omitting `SSBOND` records, would not be caught. Extending it needs
  RCSB entity annotations rather than the coordinate file alone.
- **T16 BSA covers protein–protein only**: nucleic-acid and protein–ligand interfaces are out of
  scope for the tolerance as written (protein-only atom selection).
- **T17 independent NMR oracle**: no local wwPDB NMR validation / PROCHECK-NMR / RPF install;
  deposited validation reports are fetched per entry. A deliberate gap in `ref/oracle_tools.md`.
- **ChimeraX (T01, T08), MoRDa (T09), STRIDE (T15)**: recorded deliberate gaps; install only if those
  tasks become regression targets. **STRIDE is worth more now than before**: it is a third SS
  assigner, and round 4 could not tell whether DSSP or P-SEA is the outlier when they disagree.
