## Where the tolerance work stands

Six rounds of benchmarking have replaced inferred magnitudes with measured ones. **Every tolerance
in `ref/thresholds_and_standards.md` carries `[benchmark]` provenance** (21 rows). Round 6 revisited
the three items previously carried as blocked and found **two of the three blockers were wrong** —
both were mis-invocations of a tool, not limits of it.

| Round | PR | Settled |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [#24](https://github.com/realmarcin/protstruct_review/pull/24) (2026-07-25) | interface BSA, Wilson B — the two marked *provisional* |
| 2 | [#28](https://github.com/realmarcin/protstruct_review/pull/28) (2026-07-26) | R offset, clashscore, H-placement, CA RMSD, aligned-residue count, bond-length RMSD |
| 3 | [#32](https://github.com/realmarcin/protstruct_review/pull/32) (2026-07-26) | restraint-library decomposition, Asn/Gln/His flip sets, L-test |
| 4 | [#36](https://github.com/realmarcin/protstruct_review/pull/36) (2026-07-26) | Ramachandran/rotamer outlier %, R-free, completeness, SS agreement, DockQ mapping, NMR ordered core |
| 5 | [#39](https://github.com/realmarcin/protstruct_review/pull/39) (2026-07-26) | the §4 refinement Δ-tolerances (X-ray + cryo-EM), Ramachandran favored % |
| 6 | [#42](https://github.com/realmarcin/protstruct_review/pull/42) (2026-07-26) | flip sets vs reduce2, rotamer assignment agreement, §4 detection floor |

Per-tolerance detail lives in the audit trails under `ref/research/tolerance_benchmark_*.md` and in
the re-runnable `scripts/bench_*.py`. It is deliberately **not** duplicated here — a backlog that
accumulates a changelog stops being readable as a backlog.

The pattern held to the end. Tolerances generalised from a single observation — clashscore ±1.0 from
one 1SAR pair; H-count ±0.1 % from one builder in two conventions; the SS floor ≥0.80 from 1SAR
alone; the bond-length attribution by analogy with bond angles; the DockQ and NMR preconditions
asserted with no magnitude at all — **every one moved when measured**. Three moved by more than an
order of magnitude; one (SS agreement) was the wrong *shape* of check entirely; and the §4 bands in
round 5 were breached by re-refining a deposited model against its own data, with no modelling
change at all.

Carry the same suspicion into anything added next: a tolerance that has never been run is a
hypothesis, and in this repo the hypothesis lost 21 times out of 21. Round 6 adds a corollary —
**a "blocked" item is also a hypothesis**. Two of the three blockers dissolved on re-examination:
`reduce2` reports flips once `add_flip_movers=True` is passed (it defaults off), and the §4
false-negative side was testable all along by damaging models rather than refining them.

## Open

Round 6 closed all three previously-open items — **two of the three "blockers" were wrong**. What
remains is narrower.

### [ ] §4 map-model half: half-maps for `d_FSC_model`

Still the one clause with no measurement. `phenix.mtriage`'s model-map FSC crossings are degenerate
without half-maps (27WR reports FSC = 0.5 at 29.79 Å for a 2.7 Å map; `resolution=` does not fix it,
and the log shows `d99 (half map 1): None`). EMDB serves half-maps as separate downloads
(`emd_<id>_half_map_1.map.gz`).

**Execute:** extend `scripts/bench_refinement_deltas_em.py` to fetch both half-maps and pass them to
mtriage, then re-derive the `d_FSC_model_post ≤ d_FSC_model_pre + 0.05 Å` band. Until then the clause
is documented as ungateable rather than enforced.

### [ ] Widen the §4 evidence base

Round 5 used 8 X-ray + 2 EM entries for the null case; round 6 used 9 for detection. Both are thin,
and two specific numbers rest on single observations:

- the **clashscore ratio gate (≥ 5×)** sits in the gap between a null maximum of 4.26× (n = 8) and a
  σ = 0.1 Å damage minimum of 8.5× (n = 9). A wider set could close that gap.
- the **EM CC_mask band** rests on 2 entries, one of which consumed 65 % of it on a null refinement.

### [ ] Rotamer favored/allowed boundary — the residual unknown

Round 6 showed the rotamer *assignment* is reproduced exactly (8054/8054 residues), so ± 1.0 pp is
not at risk from assignment disagreement. What remains unverified is how each pipeline draws the
**favored/allowed boundary** for a given assignment — neither the wwPDB report nor `phenix.rotalyze`
exposes the underlying rotamer-library density, so the two cannot be compared at that level without
a third tool that does.

## Not actionable in this repo (listed so the gaps are explained, not recommended)

- **ctruncate Wilson-plot fit range** (residual confound from #19): the fit ranges were not matched
  because ctruncate does not report the range it used, so the measured 13.7 % is an upper bound on
  estimator divergence. Needs a ctruncate that reports or accepts an explicit range. *Partial local
  probe:* re-run `phenix.xtriage` with a restricted low-resolution cutoff to bound how much of the
  gap is range choice — worth doing only if the Wilson-B tolerance becomes load-bearing.
- **L-test matched resolution range**: the same shape, and confirmed unachievable — ctruncate
  restricts the L-test by a median 0.46 Å and its usage line exposes no resolution flag. Recorded as
  a caveat on the tolerance rather than a gate.
- **Fragment guard is `SSBOND`-only** (from #25): a cleaved molecule held together by something other
  than a disulfide, or an entry omitting `SSBOND` records, would not be caught. Extending it needs
  RCSB entity annotations rather than the coordinate file alone.
- **T16 BSA covers protein–protein only**: nucleic-acid and protein–ligand interfaces are out of
  scope for the tolerance as written (protein-only atom selection).
- **T17 independent NMR oracle**: no local wwPDB NMR validation / PROCHECK-NMR / RPF install;
  deposited validation reports are fetched per entry. A deliberate gap in `ref/oracle_tools.md`.
- **ChimeraX (T01, T08), MoRDa (T09), STRIDE (T15)**: recorded deliberate gaps; install only if those
  tasks become regression targets. **STRIDE is worth more now than before**: it is a third SS
  assigner, and round 4 could not tell whether DSSP or P-SEA is the outlier when they disagree.

## Other tracked work

- **GitHub #3** *(closed — informational)*: T15/T16/T17 runnable; only web/report-blocked pieces remain.
- **GitHub #18, #19** *(closed 2026-07-25, PR #24)*: the two provisional tolerances.

  interfaces, cache written into the working tree, multi-block sf-cifs.
- **GitHub #29, #30, #31** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #28)*: two-block `model_vs_data` logs and outlier

- **GitHub #33, #34, #35** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #32)*: subset-dependent library share,
  unknown-vs-mismatched L-test ranges, and the het-dictionary difference that exposed a wrong
  H-count tolerance.
- **GitHub #37, #38** *(closed 2026-07-26, PR #36)*: the Ramachandran 0.00-vs-0.00 evidence base, and
  the SS-agreement metric being degenerate at the bad end.
